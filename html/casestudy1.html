            <h3>Seeking inspiration and complementing strengths and weaknesses</h3>
            <p>Before starting to work on the project, we explored different recipe websites. During our exploration, we compared several recipe websites to determine their strengths and weaknesses. One of the things we noticed is that many recipe websites tend to be too flashy, with an overwhelming amount of information and colors. While this may initially catch a user's attention, it can also be distracting and make it difficult for them to find what they're looking for. However, we did find that some websites had layouts that were helpful for us to reference.
                <br><br>

                To ensure that our website would meet the needs of users, we conducted user research to gather their feedback. The majority of users we spoke with expressed a desire for a simple and easy-to-navigate website. They also emphasized the importance of being able to filter recipes based on specific criteria, such as dietary restrictions or ingredients. By taking these user expectations into account, we aim to create a website that is not only visually appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly.

            <h3>Designing the Blueprint - The Art of Creating Effective Wireframes and Diagrams
            </h3>

            <p>In this software development project, design was not our primary focus. However, creating wireframes and diagrams was a crucial step in the development process, as we needed a clear blueprint before beginning to code. Since I was in charge of this part, I quickly got to work creating low-fidelity diagrams that could be used for initial feedback from the team.
                <br><br>

            <h3>A Deep Dive into the Technical Aspects of Our Software Development Project</h3>
            <p>In any software development project, the tech stack is a critical aspect that determines the tools and technologies that are used to build the application. Our project was no different, and we utilized a wide range of tools and technologies to ensure that we could create a high-quality product.
                <br><br>
                At the heart of our tech stack were the core web development languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages were used to build the front-end of our website, which determined how the site looked and how users interacted with it. 
                <br><br>
                For the back-end of our website, we used Firebase and Node.js. Firebase provided us with a serverless architecture, which meant that we did not have to worry about managing our own servers. Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to build scalable and efficient applications.
                <br><br>
                To manage our dependencies and packages, we used Yarn, which is a package manager that allowed us to easily install, update, and manage the dependencies for our project. 
                <br><br>
                We also used GitHub, which is a popular code hosting platform that allowed us to collaborate and manage our code repository with ease. Additionally, we used Netlify to deploy and host our website, ensuring that it was accessible to users from around the world.
                <br><br>
                Finally, we utilized Jest and Babel for testing and automation purposes. Jest is a popular testing framework that allowed us to test our code and ensure that it was functioning as intended. Babel is a tool that allowed us to write modern JavaScript code and then compile it down to a version that was compatible with older browsers.
                <br><br>
                Overall, our tech stack was an essential aspect of our software development project, and we utilized a wide range of tools and technologies to ensure that we could build a high-quality website. By leveraging these technologies, we were able to create a website that was scalable, efficient, and user-friendly.

            <h3>Behind the Scenes of Our Software Development - The Decision Making Journey That Shaped Our Project</h3>

            <div>
                <h4>Use Cloud or Local Database Storage</h4>
                <p>[screenshot corresponding to this feature]</p>
                <p><b>Context and Problem Statement:</b> In order to provide a seamless experience for users accessing recipes, our team needed to decide on the most effective way to store them. The primary consideration was whether to use cloud or local database storage. </p>
                <p><b>Considered Options:</b> We considered both cloud and local database storage as potential options for storing the recipes. Local storage would have the advantage of being more secure, as the data would be stored on the user's own device. However, this would limit the user's ability to access the recipes from multiple devices, which was an important consideration. On the other hand, cloud storage would enable users to easily access their recipes from any device with an internet connection, making it more convenient for users who use multiple devices.</p>
                <p><b>Decision Outcome:</b> After careful consideration, we ultimately decided to use cloud storage for storing the recipes. The decision was based on several factors, including the need for users to access their recipes from any device, as well as the ability to easily save recipes for meal plans on the cloud. This choice would provide users with greater flexibility and convenience in accessing and managing their recipes.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Types of Filters</h4>
                <p>[screenshot corresponding to this feature]</p>
                <p><b>Context and Problem Statement:</b> We aimed to provide a user-friendly experience for users when searching for recipes on the website. In order to achieve this, we needed to decide on the most relevant and useful types of filters to include.</p>
                <p><b>Considered Options:</b> We considered several options for types of filters to include on the website, including type of cuisine, time, cost, meal of the day, dietary restrictions, and main ingredient. Type of cuisine was considered as a potential filter, as it can help users narrow down their search based on their culinary preferences. Time was also considered, as it can help users quickly find recipes that can be prepared within their available time frame. Cost was an important factor to consider, as the target audience for the website are college students, who may be more budget-conscious. Meal of the day was considered to help users find recipes that fit a specific meal time. Dietary restrictions were also considered as a potential filter, as many users have specific dietary requirements. Finally, the main ingredient was also considered as a filter, as it can help users narrow down their search based on their preferred ingredients.        </p>
                <p><b>Decision Outcome:</b> After careful consideration, we decided to include filters for time, cost, dietary restrictions, and main ingredient. Time was chosen as a filter as it is important information for users when deciding whether to make a recipe, especially for our target audience of college students who are likely to be time-constrained. Cost was chosen as a filter as users should know how much a recipe costs, especially for our target audience. Dietary restrictions were selected as a filter to show our users that their restrictions are being considered, as it is important for users with specific dietary needs to be able to find appropriate recipes. Finally, the main ingredient was chosen as it is the most common criteria users would filter by, making it an essential filter for providing an effective search experience.</p>

                <h4>Include or Not Include Sidebar Quick Search Function</h4>
                <p>[screenshot corresponding to this feature]</p>
                <p><b>Context and Problem Statement:</b> In our project, we aimed to improve the efficiency of user searches on our recipe website. We considered whether or not to include a quick search function in the sidebar. </p>
                <p><b>Considered Options:</b> Our team discussed including a quick search function in the sidebar as well as not including it.</p>
                <p><b>Decision Outcome:</b> After careful consideration, we decided not to include a quick search function in the sidebar. We recognized that the search bar was already present and easily accessible from every page, so a quick search function would be redundant. Additionally, it might have required a lot of coding effort to only save a few clicks, which we deemed not necessary. By not including the sidebar quick search function, we were able to simplify our design and reduce potential coding complexity while still providing users with efficient search options through the search bar.</p>

This involved researching and gathering information to make informed decisions that aligned with our project goals. 
                    <br><br>
                    One key skill I developed during this process was effective communication. It was important to clearly articulate my thoughts and ideas to the rest of the team. By doing so, we were able to discuss and weigh the pros and cons of each option before making a final decision. Effective communication was also essential in ensuring that we were all on the same page and working towards a common goal.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, the decision-making process helped me to develop critical thinking skills. I learned to look at problems from multiple perspectives and to consider the potential consequences of each decision. It was important to evaluate the options based on our project goals and to determine which solution would yield the best results.
